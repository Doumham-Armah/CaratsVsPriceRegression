In this notebook I created a linear regression model by using Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) for 2 variables: carats(diamond's weight) and price.
Carats is put on the x-axis since it's the independent variable and price on the y-axis since it is the response.

I also created a scatterplot of the relationship between price and weight and the output from the regression model to arrive at the conclusions:
1- For every 0.01 carat increase in the carat size, we can expect the price to increase by 37.21 dollars.
2- 97.8% of the variability in price can be explained by the diamonds size.
3- Using the R-squared value and the relationship in the scatterplot, the value of the correlation coefficient is 0.99
