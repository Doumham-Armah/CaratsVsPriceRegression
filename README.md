In this notebook I created a **linear regression model** by using **Ordinary Least Squares(OLS)** for 2 variables: **carats**(diamond's weight) and **price**.
Carats is put on the _x-axis_ since it's the independent variable and price on the _y-axis_ since it is the response.

I also created a scatterplot of the relationship between price and weight and the output from the regression model to arrive at the follwoing conclusions:
<br />
  - For every 0.01 carat increase in the carat size, we can expect the price to increase by 37.21 dollars.  <br />
  - 97.8% of the variability in price can be explained by the diamonds size.  <br />
  - Using the R-squared value and the relationship in the scatterplot, the value of the correlation coefficient is 0.99  <br />
